# Design Computer Network â€” B.Tech Final Year Project (2019)

**College Project (B.Tech, 2015â€“2019)**

This repository hosts my final-year academic project, *Design Computer Network*, completed in 2019. It covers the endâ€‘toâ€‘end design and implementation of a scalable network for a 5â€‘storey organization with **1,000+ nodes** (including **400 wireless**).

## Project PDF
- ðŸ“„ **Main report:** [`pdf/Design-Computer-Network-BTech-2019.pdf`](pdf/Design-Computer-Network-BTech-2019.pdf)
  - *Add your PDF to the `/pdf` folder with the exact filename above.*

## At a Glance
- **Scale & Topology:** Star topology; ~1,000 nodes across 5 floors; 400 wireless nodes; 600 wired nodes.
- **Services & Infrastructure:** DHCP for dynamic IPs, Group Policy for centralized settings, Disk Quotas for storage governance.
- **Server Roles:** FTP, HTTP (local web hosting), WDS (OS deployment), centralized antivirus management.
- **Data Protection:** RAID for data security and resilience.
- **Printing & Access:** Network printers across departments; shared internet with policyâ€‘based access.
- **Directory & Identity:** Active Directory domain integration.

## Highlights
- Planned and estimated core network components (L2/L3 switches, routers, patch panels, cabling, access points, firewall, racks).
- Implemented **DHCP (DORA)**, **Group Policy** (common desktop/security), **Disk Quotas**, **WDS**, **FTP/HTTP** servers.
- Deployed **RAID** for fault tolerance and **centralized AV** monitoring.
- Configured **network printing** and **policyâ€‘based internet sharing**.
- Documented assumptions, floorâ€‘wise distribution, and scalability considerations.
